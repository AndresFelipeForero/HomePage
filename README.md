## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I learned that the only way I was able to modify the size of an image "svg" was using scale. If somebody know another way, then i'd be thank.

```css
.nav__logo {
  transform: scale(.7);
}
```

### Continued development

I didn't need this technology in this project, but a want to learn "GSAP".
